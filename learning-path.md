# Learning Path

## The road you choose

![image info](./images/many-roads.jpg)

Many pathways have led or are leading you to your technical career. Some are traditional or non-traditional, others a mix of both. Some of us learn by doing, others by attending boot camps or another type of training or certification. 
Whatever your learning path is, it must be continuous because technology is not constant. It is constantly changing.
Because there are so many factors involved in learning about the technology, we wanted to take the opportunity
to explore technical roles and how you got there. College, Bootcamp, self-taught, certifications.
