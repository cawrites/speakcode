## **Do you speak code?**

Developers reuse code as part of maintenance, new development, or upgrades. Automation can be a framework designed to deploy new releases; with minor edits to existing code.  SRE (Software Reliability Engineers) use code to monitor web, application, and database activities. 

Using an existing library of code, developers can develop new functions or features within the application. These changes are made for accessibility or a change in standards or needs of the business.

### **Examples of code that can be recycled or reused**

**Microservices** (A distinctive method of developing software systems that focus on building single-function modules with well-defined interfaces and operations.). 

**Web APIs** (an application programming interface for either a web server or a web browser) and other web-related components often reuse code.

**Object-oriented programming (OOP)** organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic

**Modular programming**  is a design technique that emphasizes separating the functionality of a program into independent, interchangeable modules, such that each contains everything necessary to execute only one aspect of the desired functionality.

### **Tips for building a code library**

* Choose a consistent method for storing and editing modified code. Github is an excellent example of retaining code ownership, history, and change.

* If using a template, maintain the framework and save copies separately for changes. 

* Research templates and APIs for usability and accessibility.

* Well-documented code and use case.

### **Challenges?**

* Limited knowledge or access to useable code.
* New role or job with limited experience
* Code base changes and a new language is used.

Developers can literally spend hours look through blogs, forums, and support for useable code.

### **We need your help**

**Speak Code** is a way to share your learnings with the community. We are collecting code from the global developer community to share with the world. We are community driven and just getting started so we appreciate your support.
